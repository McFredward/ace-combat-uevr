## Important Warnings

**⚠️ Warning: UEVR requires a very powerful gaming PC! The motion may lag even if the game itself runs smoothly.  
It is highly recommended to set the in-game graphics settings to medium to ensure optimal performance.**

> **Note:** Even with my RTX 4090 and AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, I had to set the graphics to medium for smooth operation.

2. Launch the YawVR Game Engine.
3. Select the Ace Combat 7 profile and start it.
4. Launch Ace Combat 7.
